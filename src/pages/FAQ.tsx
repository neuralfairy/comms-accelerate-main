          question: "What is messaging strategy and why do I need it?",
          answer: "Messaging strategy is the strategic approach to crafting, testing, and optimizing your sales communications to maximize conversion rates. It involves understanding your audience, developing compelling value propositions, and systematically improving your messaging based on data and feedback. Businesses need messaging strategy because generic, untested messages often fail to resonate with prospects, leading to low conversion rates and missed opportunities."
        },
        {
          question: "How quickly can I see results from message optimization?",
          answer: "Most clients see initial improvements within 2-4 weeks of implementing our messaging strategies. However, significant results typically emerge within 30-60 days as we gather data, test variations, and refine approaches. The timeline depends on factors like your current messaging baseline, target audience, and implementation consistency."
        },
        {
          question: "Do you work with both B2B and B2C companies?",
          answer: "While we specialize in B2B messaging strategy, our frameworks and methodologies can be adapted for B2C companies, especially those with longer sales cycles or higher-value offerings. Our expertise is particularly strong in SaaS, professional services, and technology sectors."

Our platform provides statistical significance calculations and automated winner selection to ensure reliable results."
        },

        },
        {
